# End-to-End Instructions: AI-Based Go / No-Go Contract Scoring

## Purpose

This section provides a complete, step-by-step guide to use this capability document with any AI tool to:

* Compare Techxl capabilities against released RFPs/RFQs/EOIs
* Generate an objective *Go / No-Go score*
* Provide justification for bid decisions

---

## Step 1: Prepare Documents

You need two documents:

1. *Techxl Capability Statement* (this document)
2. *Opportunity Document* (RFP, RFQ, tender notice, SOW, or commercial requirement)

Ensure both documents are:

* In text-based PDF, DOCX, or TXT format
* Free of scanned-only pages (OCR if required)

---

## Step 2: Upload Documents to AI Tool

Upload both documents into your AI system (examples):

* Azure OpenAI / Copilot Studio
* Custom RFP-matching AI
* Document comparison LLM tool
* Internal chatbot with document ingestion

Label documents clearly:

* Document A: Techxl Capability Statement
* Document B: Opportunity / Contract

---

## Step 3: Use the Scoring Prompt (Recommended)

Use the following *standard prompt* inside your AI tool:

"You are a contract evaluation assistant. Compare Document A (Techxl Capability Statement) with Document B (Opportunity Requirements).

Score alignment across the following criteria:

1. Technical Capability Match (0–30)
2. Platform & Technology Alignment (0–20)
3. Industry & Domain Experience (0–15)
4. Compliance, Security & Governance Fit (0–15)
5. Delivery Model & Scalability (0–10)
6. Strategic & Differentiation Fit (0–10)

Total Score: 100

Provide:

* A numeric score for each category
* Overall Go / No-Go recommendation
* Key strengths
* Identified gaps or risks
* Bid confidence level (High / Medium / Low)"

---

## Step 4: Scoring Logic (AI Decision Rules)

### Go / No-Go Thresholds

* *80–100* → GO (Strong Fit)
* *65–79* → CONDITIONAL GO (Gaps manageable)
* *Below 65* → NO-GO (High risk / misalignment)

### Mandatory No-Go Conditions (AI should flag):

* Required technology not supported
* Mandatory compliance not addressed
* Unrealistic delivery timelines
* Industry experience explicitly required but missing

---

## Step 5: Expected AI Output Format

The AI response should follow this structure:

1. *Overall Score:* XX / 100
2. *Recommendation:* Go / Conditional Go / No-Go
3. *Score Breakdown:*

   * Technical Capability: XX/30
   * Platform Alignment: XX/20
   * Industry Experience: XX/15
   * Compliance & Security: XX/15
   * Delivery & Scalability: XX/10
   * Strategic Fit: XX/10
4. *Strengths:* (bullet points)
5. *Gaps / Risks:* (bullet points)
6. *Bid Confidence Level:* High / Medium / Low

---

## Step 6: Optional JSON Output (For Automation)

If your AI tool supports structured output, request the response in JSON:

json
{
  "overall_score": 82,
  "recommendation": "GO",
  "breakdown": {
    "technical": 26,
    "platform": 18,
    "industry": 13,
    "compliance": 12,
    "delivery": 7,
    "strategic": 6
  },
  "strengths": ["Strong Power Platform alignment", "Relevant healthcare experience"],
  "risks": ["Limited mention of specific certifications"],
  "confidence": "High"
}


---

## Step 7: Internal Review & Decision

Use the AI output to:

* Validate bid feasibility
* Identify required partners or mitigations
* Decide Go / No-Go within minutes instead of days

Human review is recommended for *Conditional Go* decisions.

---

## Best Practices

* Keep this capability document updated quarterly
* Add certifications and past performance as appendices
* Train AI on past successful and failed bids for higher accuracy
* Use the same scoring prompt consistently for fairness

---

This process enables Techxl to make *data-driven, repeatable, and defensible bid decisions* for both government and commercial contracts.
